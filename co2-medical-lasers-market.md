<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Medical Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fractional CO2 Laser</li><li>Completely Ablative CO2 Laser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 medical laser market is primarily categorized into two types: fractional CO2 lasers and completely ablative CO2 lasers. Fractional CO2 lasers deliver energy in a pixelated pattern, promoting skin healing while minimizing downtime, making them suitable for wrinkle reduction and scar treatment with targeted precision. Conversely, completely ablative CO2 lasers remove entire layers of skin tissue, leading to more dramatic results for severe skin imperfections but typically requiring longer recovery periods. Both types enhance aesthetic treatments and dermatological procedures.</p></p>
