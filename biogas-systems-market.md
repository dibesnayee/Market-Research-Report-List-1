<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biogas systems can be categorized into two main types based on the digestion process: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion involves the use of liquid substrates, typically with a high moisture content, making it suitable for organic waste with significant water content, such as food waste and sewage. In contrast, dry digestion operates with solid substrates that have lower moisture content, making it ideal for materials like agricultural residues and manure. Both systems effectively convert organic materials into biogas for renewable energy.</p></p>
